# Machine-Learning

Supervised Learning Approach to Retail Sales Prediction 

•	Conducted comprehensive data importation, cleaning, and exploration, including the creation of new features. Additionally, performed feature engineering to prepare the dataset for training.

•	Implemented supervised learning algorithms including Linear Regression, Lasso, Ridge, Elastic Net, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost on sales data.

•	Utilized GridSearchCV and BayesianSearchCV optimization techniques for hyperparameter tuning in each model.

•	Evaluated model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), R Squared (R2), and Adjusted R Squared.

•	Conducted thorough analysis to compare and select the most effective model for predicting sales.


Unsupervised Learning Approach to Mall Customer Segmentation 

•	Implemented unsupervised learning techniques, including K-means and Hierarchical Clustering algorithms, to segment mall customers into distinct groups.

•	Conducted thorough data preprocessing, visualization, and exploratory data analysis to extract valuable insights from the dataset.

•	Utilized the elbow method and silhouette analysis to determine the optimal number of clusters for different subsets of features. Additionally, generated a dendrogram for clearer interpretation and visualization, enhancing the accuracy of the clustering results.
